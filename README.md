#Mongoose ODM-(object data modelling or object data mapper)

In the programming world, a schema is like a blueprint for storing information in a database. It tells us what kind of information we can save and how it should be organized. For example, if we want to store information about animals, the schema might say that each animal should have a name, age, and type.

Now, let's say we want to build many animals using this blueprint. We would follow the schema and create different animals with names, ages, and types, just like building different LEGO animals with the same LEGO pieces.

Here's where the "model" comes in! In programming, a model is like a tool that helps us create and manage our animals according to the schema. It's like a helper that knows exactly how to build each animal correctly. So, whenever we want to add a new animal, the model helps us do it the right way, making sure all the required information is there.
